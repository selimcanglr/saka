- Keep the current commands as quick options, but move on to a more sophisticated UI:

  - List all books by default once CLI is started, upon selection of a book, display actions that can be taken on that book: rate, log

  - After a log action, keep logging

  - Place a "Add Book" option at the top of the book list

  

  - Keep "book started", "finished" kind of event timestamps, and progress
